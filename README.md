### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a restaurant REST API using PHP and Laravel.

### Brief

Frogo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, has a great idea. He wants to build a restaurant that serves traditional dishes from the world of Middle Earth. The restaurant will be called "The Dancing Pony" and will have a cozy atmosphere.

Frogo has hired you to build the website for his restaurant. As payment, he has offered you either a chest of gold or a ring. Choose wisely.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **PHP**
    -   Framework: **Laravel**
-   Implement a REST API returning JSON
-   Implement a custom user model with a "nickname" field
-   Implement a dish model. Each dish should have a name, description, image, and price.
    -   Choose the appropriate data type for each field
    -   Add validation to the dish model fields to ensure that the name and description fields are unique
-   Provide an endpoint to authenticate with the API using username, password and return a JWT
-   Provide REST resources for the authenticated user for the Dish resource
    -   Implement the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for this resource:
        -   **Create**: Allow authenticated users to create new dishes
        -   **Read**: Allow authenticated users to view details of specific dishes, as well as a list of dishes
            -   Make the List resource searchable with query parameters
            -   Implement pagination for the /dishes resource. Allow users to set a limit and offset for the number of dishes returned in the response
        -   **Update**: Allow authenticated users to update dishes
        -   **Delete**: Allow authenticated users to delete dishes
    -   Implement an endpoint to rate a dish (POST)
        -   Store the rating on the Dish model
    -   Implement rate limiting for the /dishes resource to prevent abuse

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **PHP** best practices
-   Make sure that users can only rate dishes once
-   Bonus: Make sure the user _Sméagol_ is unable to rate any dish at "The Dancing Pony"
-   Bonus: Write an API test for the rating endpoint

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

Best of luck, and happy coding!
